          - This is the third 2-CD set from the amazing AfroHorn Ensemble, the
          third part of a trilogy dealing with the mythic Afro-Horn. There are
          only known to be three actual "Afro-Horns" on this planet. The horns
          are forged in a rare metal only found in Africa and South America. No
          one knows who forged the horns but some think that it was the
          Egyptians. There is one in a heavily-guarded European museum and
          another on the west coast of Mexico, amongst a tribe of Indians.
          Former drummer for the Sun Ra Arkestra, Francisco Mora Catlett, has
          organized his own cosmic crew, an all-star ensemble featuring a number
          of NYC greats: saxists Sam Newsome, Salim Washington, Bruce Williams &
          Alex Harding, plus Cuban pianist Aruán Ortiz, bassists Rashaan Carter
          & Ugona Okewo, several percussionists: Roman Diaz, Andrew Daniels &
          Catlett himself plus special guest Abiodun Oyewale from the Last
          Poets. This colossal 2-CD set pays tribute to poet Henry Dumas and Sun
          Ra. Rhythms, ancient and otherwise are central to what holds this
          music/concept together. After a fine, ritualistic opening, Sam
          Newsome’s “The Snake Charmer from Tangier” erupts and comes from a
          wonderful solo soprano CD that Mr. Newsome released last year. The sly
          groove and infectious melody help us to feel better since this is
          indeed medicine for those in need or positive spirits. The piano solo
          by Aruán Ortiz is sublime yet stunning, as is Mr. Newsome’s soprano
          solo. “Sister Harriet” is part of a suite for Harriet Tubman and was
          on an earlier disc by Mr. Catlett. This piece has an enchanting
          Trane-like modal vibe with an inspired, uplifting tenor solo from
          Salim Washington and superb bass solo from Rashaan Carter. Another
          infectious, McCoy Tyner-ish song is called, “Spirit One Voice”, which
          features an astonishing bari solo from Alex Harding, another one of
          NYC’s best kept secrets. Disc 2 starts with a splendid poem dedicated
          to and entitled “Sun Ra”. The poem is written & performed by Abiodun
          Oyowale from the legendary Last Poets. The music has that joyous,
          repeating riff, Sun Ra-like groove with layers of swirling saxes, like
          serpents swimming together. It is c ertainly rare to hear anyone cover
          a song by Detroit’s Kenny Cox, who had a couple of great albums on
          Blue Note in the late sixties. AfroHorn do a swell rendition of Cox’s
          “Mandela’s Muse”. Even better is even more excellent solos from Alex
          Harding & Sam Newsome on “Baba”, inspired from the Yoruba heritage in
          Cuba. There is an organic, spiritual vibe, which runs throughout,
          making the third chapter of the Afro-Horn odyssey another gem to
          behold.<br></br> - Bruce Lee Gallanter, DMG

          AFRO HORN [FRANCISCO MORA With SAM NEWSOME/SALIM WASHINGTON/ALEX
          HARDING/ et al] - Rare Metal (AACE 13-0001; USA) This is the second
          release from Francisco Mora Catlett's Afro-Horn ensemble, the
          personnel is Sam Newsome on soprano sax, Salim Washington on tenor
          sax, oboe & flute, Alex Harding on bari sax & bass clarinet, Aruan
          Ortiz on piano, Rashaan Carter on acoustic & electric bass, Roman Diaz
          & Andrew Daniels on percussions and Francisco More Catlett on drums,
          percussion, artistic director & composer. Henry Dumas wrote, "There
          are only three Afro-Horns in the world. They were forged from a rare
          metal found only in Africa and South America." Is this a myth or is it
          true phenomena? The Afro-Horn Ensemble was conceived in presence of
          Sun Ra on his home-world when Francisco was a member of the Arkestra
          in the mid-seventies. The Afro-Horn Myth has evolved and has left us
          with this music which transcends our time and celebrates our
          ancestors. The is the second part of Afro-Horn story and it is indeed
          a joyous occasion. <br></br> I've played this disc perhaps a half
          dozen times in the past week and all I can say is "Wow!", Francisco
          and his evolving ensemble have done it again! Francisco always goes a
          great job of assembling an incredible, powerful and inspired ensemble.
          The three man sax section with Newsome on soprano, Salim on tenor and
          Harding on bari sax sound as if they have been playing together for
          millennia: a tight, spirited, superb blend. The rhythm team also is
          well chosen. Cuban pianist, Aruan Ortiz, has discs out on Sunnyside,
          Fresh Sound and FMR is one of the best new pianists to come to New
          York in recent memory. Bassist Rashaan Carter, who plays with the
          Cosmosamatics and Antoine Roney, is also a young master. The
          heart/center of this band is/are the three percussionists: Roman Diaz,
          Andrew Daniels and Francisco himself. These three weave a fine web of
          rhythmic lines (thumb piano, congas and assorted hand percussion)
          together, swirling, inspiring and uplifting the spirits higher and
          higher. Besides the three saxes, Francisco utilizes other reeds as
          well: flute, oboe and bass clarinet, adding another layer of harmonies
          to this already swell spiritual ensemble. Even when the unit lays
          back, like on "Baruasuayo Mamakenya", they remain enchanting with
          elegant piano and percussion supporting those swell slow burning solos
          and floating rhythms. All three saxes get there chance to solo and
          shine when their time comes. It is the full ensemble playing and
          arranging that rings true throughout, consistently infectious and
          deeply committed to resurrecting the Afro-Horn Myth whether you
          believe in it or not. This fantastic disc is more than 64 minutes long
          and is excellent throughout its long duration. The Afro-Horn Ensemble
          is starting to play live over the past year, so don't miss them if you
          get the chance. They will no doubt knock your socks off if you are
          still wearing any you sandal-wearing fools.<br></br> - DMG / Bruce Lee

          [FRANCISCO MORA CATLETT/JD ALLEN/VINCENT BOWENS/ALEX HARDING/ARUAN
          ORTIZ et al] <br></br> Description: Francisco was proud to present
          Afro Horn for the first time in New York City at The Stone and
          Cornelia Street Cafe last year. Once again he built a strong and
          appropriate lineup and music for this exciting concept. He managed to
          align himself with a band of Detroiters: Alex Harding (baritone sax),
          Salim Washington (tenor sax) and Hakim Jami (bass), all transplanted
          New Yorkers who began in Detroit. Francisco is a drummer and composer
          who in the Jazz tradition brings alive the African Heritage in his
          music and art. The new Afro Horn project is the AFRO HORN MX 2012 CD
          release, with a new outstanding line up: JD Allen & Vincent Bowens
          (tenor saxes), Alex Harding (baritone sax), Aruan Ortiz (piano),
          Rashaan Carter (bass), Roman Diaz (percussion) and Francisco Mora
          Catlett (drums).<br></br> "Mr. Mora Catlett played drums for the Sun
          Ra Orchestra for some seven years in the 1970's and learned about the
          spiritual side of jazz from the Saturnian big band leader himself. The
          cosmic spirit which is the central fuel for the Arkestra from the mid
          1950's onwards and which still continues today is what informs and
          inspires whatever music Francisco works on and releases. This
          incredible 2-CD set adds another chapter to Francisco's cosmic
          journey. There are only known to be three actual "Afro-Horns" on this
          planet. The horns are forged in a rare metal only found in Africa and
          South America. No one knows who forged the horns but some think that
          it was the Egyptians. There is one in a heavily-guarded European
          museum and another on the west coast of Mexico, amongst a tribe of
          Indians.<br></br> The music here often sounds somewhat free yet
          revolves around a central theme. The first longer piece is based on
          "When the Saints Go Marching In" yet it sounds completely fresh,
          organic and modern. The recording here is perfect: rich, warm and
          superbly balanced. "Barasuayo" features three saxes playing haunting
          and hypnotic harmonies over a slow, sensuous dreamscape. Mr. Mora
          Catlett's drums are always at the center of each piece and he is a
          master percussionist who never overplays yet supports each member just
          right. "Quinto Regimiento" reminds me of the Pharoah or McCoy-like
          record from the early seventies but without any screaming saxes. The
          great JD Allen (I believe) takes a great slow-burning tenor solo over
          those mesmerizing piano waves. Aruan Ortiz takes a colossal Dave
          Burrell-like piano solo with both percussionists weaving a rich web of
          rhythms underneath. The other tenorman takes his solo and keeps the
          flames blazes throughout. Bassist Rahsaan Carter who you may recall
          from his work with Michael Marcus also takes a superb contrabass solo
          here as does the bari saxist Alex Harding, another one of NY's finest
          young sax players. There is a long and wonderful poem in the enclosed
          booklet called "Advices from the Olumo", which deals with the African
          spirit world and is written in both English and Spanish. It does a
          fine job of illustrating what makes this disc so magical. Like the Art
          Ensemble of Chicago Francisco Mora Catlett's Septet blends the ancient
          and modern as well as the African and Latin streams into a most
          delectable blend. One of this year's best!<br></br> - DMG / Bruce Lee
          Gallanter, Downtown Music Gallery.<br></br> * The New Afro Horn
          project is the “AFRO HORN MX” in the 2012 double CD release, with a
          new outstanding line up; John JD Allen (Tenor Saxophone), Vincent
          Bowens (Tenor Saxophone), Alex Harding (Baritone Saxophone), Aruán
          Ortiz (Piano), Rashaan Carter (Bass), Roman Díaz (Percussion), and
          Francisco Mora Catlett (Drums).

            Artists: CRAIG TABORN / CARLO DE ROSA / FRANCISCO MORA CATLETT
          </p>
          Description: Outstanding trio featuring Craig Taborn on piano, Carlo
          De Rosa on bass and Francisco Mora Catlett on drums & compositions.
          This is former Sun Ra drum master, Francisco Catlett's second swell
          Freedom Jazz Trio disc, but this time he has replaced pianist
          Francisco Tristano with one of his Detroit homeys: the consistently
          amazing Craig Taborn. This is without a doubt one of the finest, most
          exciting and creative piano trios I've heard in a long, long while.
          You might also recognize their bassist Carlo De Rosa who has a fine
          debut disc out on a Cuneiform. This disc was recorded live at the
          Bronx Museum and has superb sound. There are just four songs and each
          one is long and involved. Each piece is dedicated to a different
          inspiration. "Suny" was written for Sun Ra and it erupts from the
          first note. It begins intense & free, yet completely focused and
          filled with floating ghosts. When the trio break into the central
          theme, it repeats over and over and washes over us lights warm rays of
          sunshine. I am reminded of those Pharoah Sanders or McCoy Tyner songs
          that uplift our spirits and soothe us. Although all three members are
          integral to the trio's intoxicating sound, it is the piano solo by
          Craig Taborn that really shows what a master he has become.
          "Oduduwa/Bara" was inspired by the cultural contribution of the
          America's African descendents and it begins sparse, calm and
          lyrically. This piece slowly ascends with the piano, the bass and then
          the drums each telling evolving stories. The flow of this piece is
          completely organic and immensely beautiful. Again Mr. Taborn's solo is
          a true gem. "Earthtones" is dedicated with deep respect to the planet
          or Mother Earth. It begins with an excellent mallet solo from Mr.
          Catlett which builds and tells a tale as it goes. Francisco has that
          magical touch of writing melodies that stay with us long after the
          songs end, touching our hearts time and time again. "Sister Harriet"
          was written for two inspirations - Max Roach and Harriet Tubman. This
          piece is immensely haunting, somber and quite lovely. I was actually
          brought to tears as the sublime waves washed over my troubled soul.
          That swell McCoy-like theme wonderful and impossible to forget. The
          entire epic-length piece is nearly 25 minutes and presents a journey
          through hills and valleys like a slow-moving train or the flow of
          traffic on a highway. As I mentioned earlier, this is certainly thee
          piano trio offering of the year. - DMG / Bruce Lee Gallanter, Downtown

            CRAIG TABORN / VAL JEANTY / ﻿GRAHAM HAYNES / et al
          </p>
          Description: Mr. Catlett is a local hero and drum wiz who played for
          the Sun Ra Arkestra for about a decade during the seventies. This is
          his fourth disc as a leader and again he has left us with a amazing
          treasure. This disc is dedicated to the Planet Earth which has had
          more than its fair share of disasters this year (Icelandic volcano,
          Haitian earthquake & the big spill in the Gulf of Mexico). Francisco
          is a master drummer so the first thing we notice about this disc is
          that those cosmic drums & Afro-Cuban percussion are at the heart of
          everything here. With a modest budget, Catlett has also produced a
          session that has superb sound on all fronts. "Barasuayo" has a
          mysterious Miles-like groove with three superb horns (tenor, cornet &
          trumpet) floating on top. Francisco has chosen a great cast for this
          date with everyone integral to the magical, cerebral and sensual
          sound. The great JD Allen has that Wayne Shorter-like dark & probing
          tone that reaches out to grab us & not let go. Electric cornetist,
          Graham Haynes, glides and slides, bathing his hypnotic Miles-like tone
          in the right amount of echo. I don't Ms. Val Jeanty, but she does a
          swell job of adding electronic spice to the sound along with Mr.
          Taborn's or perhaps Mr. Esposito's electronic keyboards, pushing the
          entire ensemble further into space. Craig Taborn is another local
          keyboard ace and here his piano is consistently adding flavor,
          providing direction and whipping out inspired solos here and these.
          Bassist Carlo DeRosa, another new name for me, plays great throbbing
          bass, helping to hold this massive nonet together and pumping lines
          together with both percussion wizards. What makes this even better is
          the swirling, interlocking layers of percussion that are infectious
          and even intoxicating at times. This music is not really free but it
          is still adventurous and filled with strong spirits. Many of the
          pieces are pretty long and the entire set runs nearly two hours. At
          first I was amazed at the consistency of the whole affair, but then
          again all three previous discs by Francisco Mora Catlett were
          extraordinary on their own. <br></br>For those who need to know,
          here's the complete personnel: JD Allen on tenor sax, Graham Haynes on
          cornet & electronics, Guido Gonzales on trumpet, Craig Taborn & Tecla
          Esposito on piano & electric keyboards, Val Jeanty on turntables &
          electronics, Carlo DeRosa on bass, Rafael Monteagudo on Afro Cuban
          percussion and Francisco Mora Catlett on drums, composition &
          production.<br></br> - DMG / Bruce Lee Gallanter, Downtown Music

            Artists: FREEDOM JAZZ TRIO [FRANCESCO TRISTANO / CARLO DE ROSA /
            FRANCISCO MORA CATLETT]
          </p>
          Description: New Under The Sun (AACE; USA) Featuring Francesco
          Tristano on piano, Carlo De Rosa on bass and Francisco Mora Catlett on
          drums. A few years back percussionist extraordinare Francisco Mora
          Catlett left us with two amazing self-produced discs. Turns out that
          Mr. Catlett had worked with Sun Ra for more than a decade and utilized
          the talents of Marshall Allen, Craig Taborn & Marcus Belgrave on those
          great discs. I finally got a chance to see & hear Francisco play live
          at The Stone last year & realized what a most creative drummer he was.
          For this disc Mr. Catlett has put together an incredible piano trio
          which features Francesco Tristano (from Luxembourg) on piano and Carlo
          De Rosa on acoustic bass. Catlett met Mr. Tristano while working with
          Carl Craig's Innerzone Orchestra in Europe while Francisco met Mr. De
          Rosa through his work with Alex Harding.
          <br></br>I played this entire disc at the store yesterday (5/26/10)
          and considering that it is some 78+ minutes long, I was blown away
          throughout. "Barasuayo" starts with just minimal percussion playing a
          subtle, simmering, sly groove. The rest of the trio take their time to
          come in as the waves slowly ascend, the piece is sublime. "Earth
          Tones" is for the planet Earth, the piano has a bit of echo on which
          casts a spell of mystery to the proceedings. Again, the trio glides
          perfectly as the suspense builds. Bassist Carlo DeRosa is at the
          center and is excellent here as he adds propulsion and finesse to this
          great trio. Mr. DeRosa takes a couple of solos and provides excitement
          whenever he does. The strong undercurrent and interplay between all
          three members is especially enchanting. One of the things that makes
          this special is the restraint that keeps the pressure from never
          boiling over, yet still there is some beautiful music that washes over
          us like a refreshing Spring shower. I get the feeling that just about
          any (jazz) piano trio lover would find this gem most charming with
          equal amounts of creativity and nuance.<br></br>- DMG / Bruce Lee
